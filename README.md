# 👵 Whats is Discord Rpc? 🧓
🎊 Rich Presence is a new feature from Discord that allows you to surface unique, interesting, and actionable data inside a Discord user's profile when they play your game! Rich Presence data should give others a clear understanding of what someone is doing so they can decide if they want to play together or not.
